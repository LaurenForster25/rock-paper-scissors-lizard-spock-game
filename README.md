# Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock Game
This fun and modern twist on the original rock, paper, scissors game will engage people of all ages and backgrounds. The origins of this game comes from the American Sitcom ‘The Big Bang Theory’, and adding two more choices to the classic game gives players the chance to put their decision making skills to the test. This is a game designed to hone your quick-thinking skills and can be shown to family, friends and colleagues alike!

Playing this game in person can often result in a lot of human error (and potenital cheating!), but with the computer as your rival, the results will be fairer as the computer's choice of hand will be completely random. 

## Features
### Header
The top of the page features a bold header that describes the game to the user: Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock. The black colour contrasts the background and the font is simple and readable but also fun. There is an icon to the left of the header which demonstrates the hand motions one would use if they were playing the game in real life. This visual representation of the game adds to an interesting and bright design. 

### Game Options
The ‘Game Options’ section lists the five options players have to choose from, with accompanying images. Again, this is a brilliant visual aid that can engage more people in the game. It can also help users who are visually impaired as they may find the images a useful method of identification.

### Game Results
This is the largest and most interactive part of the game page. In this section we have two boxes, the box on the left displays the player’s choice of ‘fighter’ and the box on the right displays the computer’s choice of ‘fighter’. These images change with each round and reset when the player presses the ‘Restart Game’ button. Underneath the box displays, a message appears for each leg of the game, when the player wins against the computer, when they lose and when they tie. It also informs them when they restart the game. The scores of both players are situated below these messages. The Restart button is bold and colourful, enticing users to play more rounds. These features really make the game an interactive experience and are helpful to visually impaired users. 

### Game Rules
At the bottom of the page there are a set of game rules. This section explains to the user how the extra two options are incorporated into a classic game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. Having these rules clearly expressed on the page, will really allow players to use their initiative and further develop their decision making skills.
