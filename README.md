# Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock Game
This fun and modern twist on the original rock, paper, scissors game will engage people of all ages and backgrounds. The origins of this game comes from the American Sitcom ‘The Big Bang Theory’, and adding two more choices to the classic game gives players the chance to put their decision making skills to the test. This is a game designed to hone your quick-thinking skills and can be shown to family, friends and colleagues alike!

Playing this game in person can often result in a lot of human error (and potenital cheating!), but with the computer as your rival, the results will be fairer as the computer's choice of hand will be completely random.
